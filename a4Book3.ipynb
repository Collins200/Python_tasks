       " 'The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex. Their estate\\n',\n",
       " 'was large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of\\n',\n",
       " 'their property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so\\n',\n",
       " 'respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their\\n',\n",
       " 'surrounding acquaintance. The late owner of this estate was a single\\n',\n",
       " 'man, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his\\n',\n",
       " 'life, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister. But her\\n',\n",
       " 'death, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great\\n',\n",
       " 'alteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and received\\n',\n",
       " 'into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal\\n',\n",
       " 'inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended to\\n',\n",
       " 'bequeath it. In the society of his nephew and niece, and their\\n',\n",
       " 'children, the old Gentleman’s days were comfortably spent. His\\n',\n",
       " 'attachment to them all increased. The constant attention of Mr. and\\n',\n",
       " 'Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from\\n',\n",
       " 'interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid\\n',\n",
       " 'comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the\\n',\n",
       " 'children added a relish to his existence.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his present\\n',\n",
       " 'lady, three daughters. The son, a steady respectable young man, was\\n',\n",
       " 'amply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large,\\n',\n",
       " 'and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age. By his own\\n',\n",
       " 'marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to his\\n',\n",
       " 'wealth. To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not\\n',\n",
       " 'so really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independent\\n',\n",
       " 'of what might arise to them from their father’s inheriting that\\n',\n",
       " 'property, could be but small. Their mother had nothing, and their\\n',\n",
       " 'father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal; for the\\n',\n",
       " 'remaining moiety of his first wife’s fortune was also secured to her\\n',\n",
       " 'child, and he had only a life-interest in it.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'The old gentleman died: his will was read, and like almost every other\\n',\n",
       " 'will, gave as much disappointment as pleasure. He was neither so\\n',\n",
       " 'unjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephew;—but\\n',\n",
       " 'he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the\\n',\n",
       " 'bequest. Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife\\n',\n",
       " 'and daughters than for himself or his son;—but to his son, and his\\n',\n",
       " 'son’s son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way, as\\n',\n",
       " 'to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear\\n',\n",
       " 'to him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate, or\\n',\n",
       " 'by any sale of its valuable woods. The whole was tied up for the\\n',\n",
       " 'benefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his father and\\n',\n",
       " 'mother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of his uncle, by\\n',\n",
       " 'such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three\\n',\n",
       " 'years old; an imperfect articulation, an earnest desire of having his\\n',\n",
       " 'own way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of noise, as to outweigh\\n',\n",
       " 'all the value of all the attention which, for years, he had received\\n',\n",
       " 'from his niece and her daughters. He meant not to be unkind, however,\\n',\n",
       " 'and, as a mark of his affection for the three girls, he left them a\\n',\n",
       " 'thousand pounds a-piece.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mr. Dashwood’s disappointment was, at first, severe; but his temper was\\n',\n",
       " 'cheerful and sanguine; and he might reasonably hope to live many years,\\n',\n",
       " 'and by living economically, lay by a considerable sum from the produce\\n',\n",
       " 'of an estate already large, and capable of almost immediate\\n',\n",
       " 'improvement. But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was\\n',\n",
       " 'his only one twelvemonth. He survived his uncle no longer; and ten\\n',\n",
       " 'thousand pounds, including the late legacies, was all that remained for\\n',\n",
       " 'his widow and daughters.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'His son was sent for as soon as his danger was known, and to him Mr.\\n',\n",
       " 'Dashwood recommended, with all the strength and urgency which illness\\n',\n",
       " 'could command, the interest of his mother-in-law and sisters.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the\\n',\n",
       " 'family; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at\\n',\n",
       " 'such a time, and he promised to do every thing in his power to make\\n',\n",
       " 'them comfortable. His father was rendered easy by such an assurance,\\n',\n",
       " 'and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might\\n',\n",
       " 'prudently be in his power to do for them.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'He was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to be rather cold hearted\\n',\n",
       " 'and rather selfish is to be ill-disposed: but he was, in general, well\\n',\n",
       " 'respected; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of\\n',\n",
       " 'his ordinary duties. Had he married a more amiable woman, he might have\\n',\n",
       " 'been made still more respectable than he was:—he might even have been\\n',\n",
       " 'made amiable himself; for he was very young when he married, and very\\n',\n",
       " 'fond of his wife. But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature of\\n',\n",
       " 'himself;—more narrow-minded and selfish.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'When he gave his promise to his father, he meditated within himself to\\n',\n",
       " 'increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand\\n',\n",
       " 'pounds a-piece. He then really thought himself equal to it. The\\n',\n",
       " 'prospect of four thousand a-year, in addition to his present income,\\n',\n",
       " 'besides the remaining half of his own mother’s fortune, warmed his\\n',\n",
       " 'heart, and made him feel capable of generosity. “Yes, he would give\\n',\n",
       " 'them three thousand pounds: it would be liberal and handsome! It would\\n',\n",
       " 'be enough to make them completely easy. Three thousand pounds! he could\\n',\n",
       " 'spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience.” He thought of\\n',\n",
       " 'it all day long, and for many days successively, and he did not repent.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'No sooner was his father’s funeral over, than Mrs. John Dashwood,\\n',\n",
       " 'without sending any notice of her intention to her mother-in-law,\\n',\n",
       " 'arrived with her child and their attendants. No one could dispute her\\n',\n",
       " 'right to come; the house was her husband’s from the moment of his\\n',\n",
       " 'father’s decease; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the\\n',\n",
       " 'greater, and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood’s situation, with only common\\n',\n",
       " 'feelings, must have been highly unpleasing;—but in _her_ mind there was\\n',\n",
       " 'a sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any offence of\\n',\n",
       " 'the kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her a source of\\n',\n",
       " 'immovable disgust. Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a favourite with\\n',\n",

       " 'So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour, and so\\n',\n",
       " 'earnestly did she despise her daughter-in-law for it, that, on the\\n',\n",
       " 'arrival of the latter, she would have quitted the house for ever, had\\n',\n",

       " '\\n',\n",

       " 'that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led\\n',\n",
       " 'to imprudence. She had an excellent heart;—her disposition was\\n',\n",
       " 'affectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern\\n',\n",
